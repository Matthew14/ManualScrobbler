# Manual Scrobbler
===============

Manual last.fm scrobbler.

Makes use of the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pylast/">pylast</a> module by Amr Hassan.

I plan to package the requirements when it's more polished.

Useful for when you've listened to music from a source that doesn't support scrobbling or doesn't have a scrobbler enabled.
